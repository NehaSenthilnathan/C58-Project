    “How dare you! All of you - standing around, deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won!”
―Princess Jasmine
        <br><br>
        Princess Jasmine is the deuteragonist of Disney's 1992 animated feature film, Aladdin. She is the independent and rebellious princess of Agrabah, a Middle Eastern kingdom ruled by her father, the Sultan. As the future Sultana, Jasmine has a strong sense of obligation to her kingdom. Because of outdated laws, however, she was forbidden to go beyond the palace walls and was forced to follow unjust practices. Refusing to be treated like a sheltered object, Jasmine desperately aspires to diverge from her societal confines, to live a life where she is free to make her own choices.
